			 <li>Romanian nationals living in the UK may only withdraw to UK bank accounts in their name.  When completing a credits transfer request it is imperative that the name on their supplied ID verification document matches the "account name" on the transfer request.  (Why is this required?  Despite all the systems put in place to prevent fraud, certain persons from this country seem insistent on tying to defraud the Site and it's membership.)

We reserve the right to cancel pending transfers that do not conform to this condition of membership.
